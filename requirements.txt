Short ML Workflow for This Project:
1. Load dataset → stock_features.csv
2. Select target & features
    Target: Close of the stock to predict
    Features: MA20, MA50, Daily_Return, Volatility, Volume (optional Open/High/Low)
3. Split dataset → train/test (e.g., 80/20)
4. Scale features → StandardScaler (for ML algorithms like LinearRegression, SVR)
5. Train model → Linear Regression / Random Forest / LSTM (for time series)
6. Evaluate model → RMSE, MAPE
7. Predict & visualize trends → Interactive Plotly graphs on website

Core Python Libraries:
pandas-	Data manipulation, CSV read/write
numpy-	Numerical operations
yfinance-	Fetch stock data
scikit-learn-	Feature scaling, ML models (Linear Regression, etc.)
statsmodels	Optional- time series analysis, ARIMA
matplotlib-	Basic plotting & visualization
seaborn-	Advanced plots & trends
plotly-	Interactive graphs for website
datetime-	Date handling

WEB:
flask-	Build the website backend
dash (optional alternative)-	Interactive dashboards
jinja2-	Flask HTML templating (comes with Flask)
